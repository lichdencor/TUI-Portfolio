Now featuring a built-in terminal that simulates POSIX commands in Bash.

## Features

- Simulated Bash-style terminal with basic POSIX-like commands (`ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `grep`, `rm`, `touch`)
- Simulated `neofetch` with host OS (browser), JS heap, and page uptime (resets on refresh)
- Retro TUI-inspired UI, styled per page and component
- Modular project and configuration context shells  
  _(e.g., `info-shell` is custom; you could implement others like `conmmanctl`, `python`, etc.)_
